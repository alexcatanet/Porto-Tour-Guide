# Porto Tour Guide

This project was developed within the scholarship program (Android Basics By Google).
The goal was to make a multi-screen Android app in order to share the knowledge about one specific city you are familiar with, also presenting relevant information to a user who's visiting your city. The app list top attractions, restaurants and public places for the city. 

## What I've learned:
This project is about combining various ideas and skills I've been practicing throughout the course. They include features like:

- Planning my app design and navigation before coding

- Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information

- Building layouts to display those lists of data

- Navigating between lists in Fragments using either a ViewPager plus TabLayout or Navigation Drawer

- Creating my own custom class

- Properly handling images or audio

##  Project Specification
### Layout

- This app contains 4 lists of relevant attractions for the Porto (Oporto) city

- Each list item contains information about an event, restaurant or historical site

- Every list includes the picture of the location

### Functionality

- The App contains a custom object for storing location information

- The App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class

- All drawables are stored at multiple densities and all images are stores as drawables
